# Checkerboard Drawing using Turtle Graphics

This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a checkerboard pattern and place checker pieces on it. It provides several functions to draw squares, circles, and columns, as well as place checker pieces on specific rows. The script includes a main function that generates the checkerboard and displays it using Turtle graphics.

## Functions

The script includes the following functions:

- `draw_square(size, color, thickness, fill_color=None)`: Draws a square with specified parameters.
- `draw_circle(radius, color)`: Draws a filled circle with specified parameters.
- `place_checker_piece(row)`: Places a checker piece on a specific row of the checkerboard.
- `draw_column(row)`: Draws a column of the checkerboard and places checker pieces as required.
- `go_to_next_row()`: Moves the turtle to the starting position of the next row in the checkerboard pattern.
- `center_checker_board()`: Adjusts the starting position of the turtle to draw a centered checkerboard.

Feel free to modify or extend these functions to suit your needs.
